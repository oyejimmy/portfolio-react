Research Project: Ensemble Deep Learning for Precise Thalassemia Classification in Blood Smear Images 
Role: Lead Researcher | Tech Stack: Python, TensorFlow, ResNet50, VGG16, MobileNetV2 
● Designed and implemented an ensemble of CNN models (ResNet50, VGG16, MobileNetV2) for classifying beta-thalassemia 
from blood smear images. 
● Achieved a 75.61% validation accuracy using ensemble learning, outperforming all individual models in both precision and 
stability. 
● Worked on a dataset of 7,108 erythrocyte images across 9 classes, focusing on clinical relevance and robustness in 
low-resource environments. 
● Conducted deep error analysis via confusion matrices and classification reports to reduce false positives in difficult cases like 
teardrop and elliptocyte cells. 
● Highlighted for potential real-world deployment to assist in early thalassemia diagnosis in rural clinical setups.
